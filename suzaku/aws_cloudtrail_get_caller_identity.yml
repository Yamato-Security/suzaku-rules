    The "whoami" for AWS. Attackers will often use this to determine the identity of the current user or role. This is a common first step in AWS reconnaissance.
    After stealing long-term or short-term access keys, attackers often run `aws sts get-caller-identity` to determine the identity of the compromised user or role.
    Any IAM user or role can call this API, and it is often used in scripts to verify the identity of the caller.
