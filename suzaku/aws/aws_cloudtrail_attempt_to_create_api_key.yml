title: Attempt To Create API Key
id: 1497f3a3-7898-484e-b1e8-22fe99efd8a4
status: test

    An attacker may have attemped to create an API key for persistence but it failed.
    Ex: aws appsync create-api-key --api-id ApiId
    I have seen this in the eventSource of `appsync.amazonaws.com` and `apigateway.amazonaws.com`.
    There are probably other services that can create API keys as well so I am leaving the eventSource open.
